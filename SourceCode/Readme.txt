Instruction of using source code

Source code is grouped by in chapters where it is referenced.  If a XLANG schedule uses COM component, you must first register the DLL before running the schedule.  All the DLLs used by the schedules are located in the folder “Components_Used_By_Schedule” of each chapter folder that contains schedules.

You may need to take several steps to setup the configuration before you can run the code or test, please refer to the instruction in each chapter where the code are referenced.
